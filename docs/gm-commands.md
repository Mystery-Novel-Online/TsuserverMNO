# GM Commands

A cmprehensive list of available commands for GMs.
GMs can bypass area passages and locks, receive special RP notifications and use GM specific commands.

---


## Area Locks

| Command | Parameters | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `/unlock` | - | Unlocks an area, provided the lock came as a result of /lock. |
| `/transient` | `<id>` | Changes a player's ability to ignore passage locks and thus access all areas from any given area. By default it is off. |
| `/bilock` | `<area 1>, <area 2>` | Changes the passage locked status (locked/unlocked) between two areas, or from the current area to area 1 if just given one area. Locking a passage in such a way does not change its current visibility to non-GMs. Areas do not need to be initially connected for this to work. |
| `/bilockh` | `<area 1>, <area 2>` | Changes the passage locked status (locked/unlocked) between two areas, or from the current area to area 1 if just given one area. Locking a passage in such a way hides it from non-GMs; unlocking it reveals it to non-GMs. Areas do not need to be initially connected for this to work. |
| `/passage_clear` | `<area range start>, <area range end>` | Clears passage locks that start in the areas in the given area range, or just the ones in the current area if not given a range. |
| `/passage_restore` | `<area range start>, <area range end>` | Restores passage locks that start in the areas in the given area range to their original status, or just the ones in the current area if not given a range. |
| `/unilock` | `<area 1>, <area 2>` | Changes the passage status (locked/unlocked) from area 1 to area 2 if given two areas, or from the current area to area 1 if just given one area. Locking a passage in such a way does not change its current visibility to non-GMs. |
| `/unilockh` | `<area 1>, <area 2>` | Changes the passage status (locked/unlocked) from area 1 to area 2, or from the current area to area 1 if just given one area. Locking a passage in such a way hides it from non-GMs; unlocking it reveals it to non-GMs. |
| `/uninvite` | `<ID/char name/showname/char showname/OOC name>` | Removes a target from your locked area's invite list, so that if they leave, they will not be allowed back until the area is unlocked. |

---

## Bloodtrail 

| Command | Parameters | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| `/bloodtrail` | - | Changes the bleeding status of a target. If bleeding, they will leave 'blood' in all areas they pass through, and send OOC notifications to players in the area and those who join indicating their status. Sneaking and bleeding players send altered notifications. |
